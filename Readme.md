## About the Game

In an endless world of chaos and feathers, you control a determined duck on a mission:  
**rescue as many ducklings as you can and lead them to safety!**

But it won't be easy:
- Dodge speeding cars and massive trucks   
- Collect ducklings to grow your adorable tail   
- Pass through gates — only if you’ve gathered enough followers  
- And beware: if one chick gets hit… you may lose part of your crew!

Inspired by **Snake** and **Frogger**, this game combines:
- The **tail mechanics** of Snake   
- The **hazard-filled crossings** of Frogger 

> Will you make it through the chaos… with all your ducklings intact?
